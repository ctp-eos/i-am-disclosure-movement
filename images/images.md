# Purpose of the `/i-am-disclosure-movement/images` Directory

The `/i-am-disclosure-movement/images` directory was created to organize and store all image assets related to the **I AM Disclosure Movement** project. This folder serves as a centralized location for visual content used across the repository, including:

- Illustrations
- Logos
- Diagrams
- Infographics
- Any other graphical media supporting the movement's messaging and documentation

### Why This Directory Is Important

- **Consistency:** Keeping all images in one place ensures that the repository structure is clean and easy to navigate.
- **Version Control:** Images stored here are tracked by Git, allowing for better management of changes, updates, or additions to visual materials.
- **Collaboration:** Contributors can quickly find and reference visual assets without confusion or duplication.
- **Branding & Communication:** Visual elements are essential in conveying the core values and messages of the I AM Disclosure Movement, helping to strengthen engagement and understanding.

### Summary

By maintaining the `/i-am-disclosure-movement/images` directory, we ensure that the visual identity and supporting media of the project remain organized, accessible, and aligned with the movement's goals.
