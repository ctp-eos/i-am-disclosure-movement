# I AM Disclosure Movement (IAMDM)

Welcome to the **I AM Disclosure Movement**, the open-source foundation of the next scientific paradigm — where energy, consciousness, and technology converge.

This repository is part of the **CTP-EOS** (Consciousness Technology Principles — Extraterrestrial Operating System) initiative, built to accelerate disclosure through code, documentation, frameworks, and tools grounded in the emerging field of **CTP Energy Science**.

We aren't waiting for permission.  
**We are disclosure.**  
We’re building the future now — in the open.

## 🌌 What is CTP Energy?

**CTP** stands for **Consciousness Technology Principles**, a measurable framework that bridges the physical and non-physical through the study of the **C-domain** — the non-physical conscious-energy field that underlies space, time, and life itself.

Backed by experimental and theoretical work, **CTP Energy Science (CTPSci)** opens new frontiers in:

- 🛰️ CTP Gravitic Propulsion  
- 🧬 CTP Healing technologies  
- 🧠 CTP Conscious interface systems  
- 🌐 Non-local communication  
- ⚡ Post-fuel energy systems  

---

## 📂 What's in this Repo?

This repository is the **meta-layer** of the movement. It includes:

- 🧭 Vision, philosophy, and scientific framing documents  
- 🛠️ Development roadmap for CTP-EOS and movement tooling  
- 📡 Protocols, interface specs, and metaphysical APIs  
- 🧑‍💻 Code samples, testbed utilities, and consciousness-mapped components  
- 📢 Community-building resources and contribution guides
